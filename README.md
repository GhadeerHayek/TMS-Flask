# Summer Training Management System with Flask

We developed a cloud-based training management web system that is designed to streamline and automate training processes in organizations. TMS offers a user- friendly interface that allows managers, advisors, and trainees to efficiently manage and track training activities. It facilitates creating training programs and meetings, tracking trainee’s attendance and progress, and providing interactive learning materials. With features such as registration approval, resolving meeting conflicts, performance assessments, and reporting tools, TMS ensures that training initiatives are effectively implemented and monitored. Its cloud-based architecture allows for easy scalability and accessibility, making it ideal for organizations of all sizes.

**TMS's Requirements** 

TMS consists of 3 components, the manager, advisor and trainee. All these components fulfil the following requirements

**1. Trainees:**
- They must register by providing necessary information, uploading
personal files and documents upon registration.
- They can apply for training programs, fill in attendance forms, and
request meetings with their advisors.

**2. Advisors:**
- They must provide necessary information for registration.
- They are classified based on their discipline, manage their own trainees and keep up with their attendance
- They can approve or reject trainee meeting request.

**3. Managers:**
- They review training and registration requests by both advisors and
trainees and decide whether to accept them or not.
- They generate unique trainee and advisor IDs, handle everyone’s
account management, manage training programs, and billing issues.
- They can update everyone’s data in the cloud.
- They can send emails to advisors and trainees.


**4. TheSystem(TMS):**
- TMS is responsible for generating highly secure and random passwords
for users upon manager’s approval of their registration request.
- It’s also responsible for resolving meeting schedule conflicts.
